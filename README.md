YouTubeInsider Tool for Visual Studio 2015

Developers refer a lot of online video tutorials (Youtube) in their life span. We agree that's the way to get started with any new language or technology. But, all tutorials don't have the link to the code, explained in the video. To get the code, developers often pause the video and type the whole code page by page. This is a cumbersome experience. What if, a tool that could help developers by extracting the code out of the Youtube tutorial video. It would extract the code and make it ready as a text or a code file for the developer, to make changes accordingly. We agree that sometimes it won't a complete code to run, but it can be evolved later to do that.

 

Future advances: Transform the whole voice narration of the steps from the video to a Workflow for the developer and automate it on OneClick to give a whole new experience in Visual Studio.
